# 22Research
A repository containing the program and the experimental data sets for the paper, "A further investigation into properties of a variant of non-trivial Collatz cycles"

The files are as follows:

"n.cvs" is a file containing all of the satisfying tuples of length n.

"all average data" is a file containing all of the averages of the satisfying tuples found.

"analysis" is a file containing some graphs and tables that has been done on Excel.

PythonFile is a file containing the Python code used for this research paper to collect the experimental data, using a novel algorithm developed by Mario Taccarelli for exhaustively searching for satisfying tuples.

Each picture of the form "___.png" can be found in the research paper and was produced in Python.
